## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Release Guidelines

Adminsitrators of this repository follow the [MDS Release Guidelines](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/blob/master/ReleaseGuidelines.md)

## Development Dependencies

In order to maintain consistency, all development dependencies related to the testing and building of the packages in this repository are installed in the root `package.json` file. This includes the various tools (`ESLint`, `Prettier`, `TypeScript`, `Jest`, etc.) as well as the default configuration settings for those tools.

One notable exception to this is the installation of TypeScript definition (`@types`) packages which are installed as regular dependencies in the individual packages that require them which is analogous to those dependencies that include their own type definitinos without a separate `@types` package.
